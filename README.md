# CodingChallenge4MongoDB
 Coding assessment for the second stage of the application for a internship in mongoDB

The language i used for this assessment was Python. I used version 3.8 of Python.
The assumptions i made for this assessment was that the person testing this code would input a file for the
program to run via the command line.I used Pycharm to build this code and then made a json file from the example given in the problem description to test whether the code was working correctly. 

To from the terminal i Used the command python main.py "nameofJSONfile".json.using this command is the way my
code runs on the terminal, i hope this is an acceptable command. 

It took my roughly 2 and a half hours to get this code working.
